## [ARCHIVED] Raycast YouTube-to-Tana Transcript Feature
- Work on sending YouTube transcripts to Tana Inbox via API is paused.
- Blocked by Tana Input API 5,000 character payload limit, which is too restrictive for full transcripts.
- Feature branch and code are preserved for future resumption if/when Tana increases the payload limit or improves the API.
