# Progress

## What Works
- Core conversion functionality for Markdown to Tana format
- Three main command workflows:
  - Quick clipboard conversion (no UI)
  - Paste and edit interface
  - Convert selected text
  - YouTube to Tana metadata extraction
- All basic Markdown elements:
  - Headings (H1-H6)
  - Bullet lists (`-`, `*`, `+`)
  - Numbered lists
  - Paragraphs
  - Nested content
- Field detection and conversion
- Python script alternative for large files
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Specialized format support:
  - YouTube transcript timestamps
  - Limitless Pendant transcriptions
  - Limitless App transcriptions
  - YouTube video metadata extraction
  - HTML entity decoding for special characters
  - Transcript chunking for large transcriptions
- Browser extension integration for YouTube videos
- Secure development workflow with branch protection
- Automated publishing process

## What's Left to Build
- More specialized format detections
- Additional formatting options
- Performance optimization for large documents
- Support for other video platforms beyond YouTube
- Enhanced metadata extraction options
- Mobile app integration

## Current Status
- Version 1.6.0 released
- ESLint configuration updated to match Raycast recommendations
- Branch protection system implemented
- Publishing workflow documented and automated
- Development vs. publishing environments clearly separated
- Currently in active development on the `development-with-memory-bank` branch

## Known Issues
- Complex nested structures require careful indentation
- Performance considerations with very large documents
- Browser extension API limitations for certain video platforms
- Occasional ESLint configuration conflicts
- Branch management confusion (now addressed with new workflow)

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests in place for core conversion logic
- Manual testing conducted for complex scenarios
- Jest testing framework implemented
- Additional test cases being developed for edge cases
- Comprehensive tests for transcription format detection and conversion
- Tests for HTML entity decoding and paragraph detection
- Tests for YouTube metadata extraction and formatting

## Implementation Process
- GitHub issue creation with clear requirements (#8)
- Feature branch development (issue-8-limitless-pendant-support)
- Parallel implementation in TypeScript and Python codebases
- Test-driven development approach
- Documentation updates (README and CHANGELOG)
- Pull request and code review
- Version bump and release
- Raycast store submission 

## Important Notes
- When using GitHub CLI (gh) commands, do not use actual newlines or escaped newlines (\n) in comments, issue descriptions, or release notes.
- Instead, create temporary markdown files for complex content and use them with the --body-file flag.
- Example: 
  1. `echo "# Title\n\n- Point 1\n- Point 2" > temp.md` 
  2. `gh issue create --title "Issue Title" --body-file temp.md`
  3. `rm temp.md`
- For simple content, use single-line text with comma separators rather than line breaks
- This applies to all gh commands including issue creation, closing, releases, and PR descriptions

## Versioning Guidelines
- **Documentation-only changes**:
  - No version bump required
  - Just commit and push to main branch
  - Include these changes in the next feature/bugfix release changelog
  
- **When to create a new version release**:
  - For actual code changes (features, bug fixes, refactoring)
  - When accumulated documentation improvements become substantial
  - Before submitting to external package registries (Raycast store)
  - After addressing significant issues or pull requests
  
- **Version bump conventions** (Semantic Versioning):
  - Patch version (1.4.2 → 1.4.3): Bug fixes, minor improvements, non-functional changes
  - Minor version (1.4.2 → 1.5.0): New features that maintain backward compatibility
  - Major version (1.4.2 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes, significant architecture changes

- **Version bump process**:
  1. Update version in package.json
  2. Update CHANGELOG.md with new version section
  3. Commit changes with message format: "chore: bump version to x.y.z"
  4. Create and push git tag
  5. Create GitHub release with change notes
  
- **Commit without version bump when**:
  - Fixing typos in documentation
  - Updating URLs or references
  - Making minor formatting changes
  - Improving comments or documentation examples
  - Changing non-user-facing content
