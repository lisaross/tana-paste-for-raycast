# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Memory bank creation and setup
- Understanding the project structure and requirements
- Identifying key components and their relationships
- Implementation of Limitless Pendant transcription support
- Version 1.6.0 release
- Memory bank maintenance and documentation
- Setting up branch structure to prevent development/publishing confusion
- Established workflow safeguards to prevent accidental work on publishing branches
- Fixing ESLint configuration to comply with Raycast recommendations

## Recent Changes
- Version 1.6.0 (2025-04-18):
  - Enhanced YouTube transcript processing with improved formatting (#33)
  - Added transcript chunking functionality for better organization
  - Enhanced Limitless Pendant transcription processing
  - Added Limitless App transcription support
- Setup of branch protection system:
  - Created clear development vs. publishing branch structure
  - Added warning systems and environment checks
  - Automated publishing workflow with safeguards
  - Created documentation for the publishing process

## Next Steps
- Continue enhancing transcript handling
- Add more format detection for specialized content
- Optimize performance for large documents
- Improve test coverage
- Publish updated version to Raycast store using new workflow

## Active Decisions
- Use development-with-memory-bank branch for all development work
- Never make changes directly to publishing branches
- Always verify environment before making changes
- Use the automated publishing process to prepare releases

## Current Challenges
- Understanding the specific requirements of Tana's format
- Tracking edge cases in the conversion process
- Balancing performance with comprehensive conversion capabilities
- Managing the dual implementation approach (TypeScript and Python)
- Balancing proper indentation with ease of use in Tana
- Ensuring consistent behavior across different transcription formats
- Managing formatting variations in different input sources
- Detecting different transcript structures and paragraph breaks

## Open Questions
- What are the most common error cases in the conversion process?
- Are there any Markdown elements not currently supported?
- How does the system handle very large documents?
- What improvements could be made to the current implementation?
- What other transcription formats might need special support?
- How can we improve the detection of different transcription formats?
- Are there additional formatting options users might need for transcriptions?
- How can we make the extension more discoverable for users of transcription tools? 
- What additional YouTube metadata might be useful to extract?
